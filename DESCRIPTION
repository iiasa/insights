Description: The package provides an implementation of the InSiGHTS modelling framework for creating climate and land-use indicators. This package acts a simple wrapper to do an area-of-habitat refinements on top of climatic envelope models or species distribution models (SDMs). By default it is assumed that such models are obtained through the ibis.iSDM package and this package contains a simple wrapper to link the two approaches.
